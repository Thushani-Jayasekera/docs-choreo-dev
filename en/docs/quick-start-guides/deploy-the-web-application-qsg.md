Once the web application component is created, you can deploy it to the Choreo runtime. To deploy the web application component, follow the steps below:

1. In the left menu, click **Deploy**.
2. In the **Build Area** card, click **Deploy Manually**. This will open the window to input configurations for your web application.
3. Add configurations and click **Deploy**. The deployment may take a few minutes to complete. You can learn how to define and read configurations at [Develop a Web Application page](https://wso2.com/choreo/docs/develop-components/develop-a-web-application/#creating-a-web-application).
4. Once the web application is deployed, copy the **Web App URL** from the development environment card.
5. Navigate to the web app URL. You can verify that the web app is successfully hosted.

Next, let's create a user to access the web application.
